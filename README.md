# Correlation Analysis on Movie Dataset

## Introduction

Performing correlation analysis on a movie dataset is an exploratory data analysis project aimed at uncovering relationships and dependencies between various attributes within the dataset. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains a comprehensive collection of information about movies, including details about their production, ratings, and financial performance.

Correlation analysis is a crucial step in understanding how different factors are related within the dataset. It can help answer questions such as:
- Are higher budgets associated with better ratings?
- Does the release year impact a movie's revenue?
- What factors influence a movie's popularity?

This project will use statistical techniques to measure the strength and direction of relationships between variables, providing valuable insights for filmmakers, studios, and movie enthusiasts.
